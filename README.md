This system is designed for covid-19 safety purposes. With this system, it is very effective to detect first symptoms of covid-19 for faster diagnosis.
Infrared sensors are very ideal in this system since covid is best prevented without having contact with infected objects.

Sit back, relax and enjoy this project while it lasts.
